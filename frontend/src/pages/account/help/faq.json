		"q": "Q#1 - Why is login so slow?",
		"a": "The website uses \"render.com\" to deploy the backend server. It's a service with great free features, safe, compliant with GDPR and with many integrations. One of the drawbacks is that free tiers (such as this), are suspended after a short period of inactivity, and can take up to 50s to get back up running. Therefore, the first request is always slower because it also needs to \"wake up\" the server."
	},
	{
		"q": "Q#2 - Why can't I delete my account?",
		"a": "This is probably due to ongoing orders (either in process, or still being delivered). Once all orders are delivered, you are then able to delete your account. You should see a notification warning about it, however if that's not the case please use the support contact bellow to warn me about this error."
	},
	{
		"q": "Q#3 - Missing authorization token",
		"a": "If you see a notification with this message, that means your session expired and for some reason you were not redirected to the appropriate url. Please click the logout button, or simply log back in from a new tab."
	},
	{
		"q": "Q#4 - Unable to contact support",
		"a": "While the support channels might be facing some unexpected problem, you can contact me directly trough my Linkedin, or email. I'm deeply sorry for the inconvenience."
	},
	{
		"q": "Q#5 - My order was not delivered",
		"a": "Thank you for your interest in reading the FAQ. I do regret to inform that this is not a real shop and thus we don't sell tea. Also...with all due respect...what were you expecting to find here?"
